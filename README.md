# react-native-triangle
Draw triangles in code with React Native

A class to encapsulate the CSS triangle hack. Based off the output of the triangle generator http://apps.eky.hk/css-triangle-generator/ but modified for React Native syntax. 

## Usage
In JSX:
```
<Triangle
  width={10}
  height={25}
  color={'#D80016'}
  direction={'right'}
/>
```
